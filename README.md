# nix-dev-template

This is my nix flake template for all things development. Should be quite easy and straightforward to use for your own purposes.

## Installation

To install, run the following in the root of your project:
```bash
nix flake new -t github:imide/nix-dev-template .
```


Then, remove the template.nix in /nix/modules and also edit the other files to your liking.

Also, please dont use my cache. pretty please.
